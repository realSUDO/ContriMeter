## Intro

Most productivity tools are bloated. We built something minimal that actually helps teams work better - track what matters, see progress in real-time, and keep everyone aligned.

**What you get:**
- Tasks that make sense - Create, assign, drag to reorder. No complexity.
- Time that counts - Built-in timer with a satisfying hourglass animation
- Team awareness - See who's working on what, right now
- Quick communication - Chat without switching apps
- Fair contributions - Track who's pulling their weight
- Your preferred vibe - Dark or light theme
